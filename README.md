# SimpleLibraryManagementSystem
Introduction to Programming With C#-Peer Assessment Project

The main purpose of this simple library management system is to manage books and users in the library. The system provides the following functions:
1. User management:
• New Users
• Delete User
2. Book management:
• New books
• Delete Books
• Loan books
• Returning books
3. Library Management:
• List all books
• Search for books
The system uses multiple classes and interfaces to implement these functions, including Book, User, LibraryManager, etc. Each class and interface has specific responsibilities, such as managing the borrowing and returning of books, managing the addition and deletion of users, etc. The system also uses concurrent dictionaries and semaphores to ensure data consistency in a multi-threaded environment.
